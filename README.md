## Welcome to Stephen Webb's _English 102: Introduction to Critical Analysis_ 

From here you will be able to see the showcased content created by both instructor and students. 

Often assignments seem only useful for the fulfillment of course requirements, and as such they both live and die in the duration of the course. It is hoped that showcasing student work herein will provide a longer life to fruits of the labours exerted by the students and the instructor. 

Together, our [Critical and Literary Terms Wiki](https://github.com/skwebb/UofA-2017-ENG102/wiki), [Broadside Ballad Response Project](https://github.com/skwebb/UofA-2017-ENG102/projects/1), and [Marginalia Hunt Project](https://github.com/skwebb/UofA-2017-ENG102/projects/2) will exhibit a range of critical reading, research, and writing skills.
